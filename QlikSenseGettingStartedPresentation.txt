hello everyone my name is Mike Zhu, I'm a Qlik Sense consultant with Deloitte Canada.  I'd like to welcome all of you to our Qlik Sense Getting Started persentation.  Thank you for spending time with me to learn about our next generation data visualizaiton platform known as Qlik Sense.  If you need to get in touch with us or are interested in learning more, you can contact us freely.  I encourage  you ask questions during the presentation and I cover them toward the end.

So let's get started with a short presentation.  Your job maybe to analyze information and answer questions and make informed decisions from ever increaing amount of that can be in many sizes and formats.  Sure, there are query based tools that can help you build visualizations, But I feel analytics is more than just creating content, it's about finding answers.  Query based tools limits your ability to explore, create so-called blind spots in your data and leaving data behind, potentially not giving you all the answers you need.

Now with Qlik Sense, you get a modern analytics platform that was designed specifically for interactive free-form exploration and analysis, all data is brought together and fully indexed from any number of data sources, analytics can be created without having to build complex queries or data models or even wire objects together and you can explore your analytics freely through search and selections in any directions with instant updates and assoications that are revealed after each click, and we call that the associative difference and and it's made by Qlik associative technology.  Now before we continue with the presentation, let's give you a brief demo of the associative difference.
